<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Case study</h2>
<p>The use of our methodology is illustrated on smart meter energy usage for a sample of customers from <a href="https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/smart-grid-smart-city-customer-trial-data">SGSC consumer trial data</a> which was available through <a href="https://data.gov.au/data/organization/doee">Department of the Environment and Energy</a> and Data61 CSIRO. It contains half-hourly general supply in KwH for 13,735 customers, resulting in 344,518,791 observations in total. In most cases, electricity data is expected to have multiple seasonal patterns like daily, weekly or annual. We do not learn about these repetitive behaviors from the linear view because too many measurements all squeezed in that representation. Hence we transition into looking at cyclic granularities, that can potentially provide more insight on their repetitive behavior. The raw data for these consumers is of unequal length, with varying start and finish dates. Because our proposed methods evaluate probability distributions rather than raw data, neither of these data features would pose any threat to our methodology unless they contained any structure or systematic patterns. Additionally, there were missing values in the database but further investigation revealed that there is no structure in the missingness (see Supplementary paper for raw data features and missingness). The study begins by subsetting a data set along all dimensions of interest using data filtering and prototyping. By grouping the prototypes using our methods and assessing their meaning, the study hopes to unravel some of the heterogeneities observed in energy usage data. Because our application does not employ additional customer data, we cannot explain why consumption varies, but rather try to identify how it varies.</p>
<p><em>Data filtering and variable selection</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose a smaller subset of randomly selected <span class="math inline">\(600\)</span> customers with no implicit missing values for 2013.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain <span class="math inline">\(wpd\)</span> for all cyclic granularities considered for these customers. It was found that <code>hod</code> (hour-of-day), <code>moy</code> (month-of-year) and <code>wkndwday</code> (weekend/weekday) are coming out to be significant for most customers. We use these three granularities while clustering.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove customers whose data for an entire category of <code>hod</code>, <code>moy</code> or <code>wnwd</code> is empty. For example, a customer who does not have data for an entire month is excluded because their monthly behavior cannot be analyzed.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove customers whose energy consumption is 0 in all deciles. These are the clients whose consumption is likely to remain essentially flat and with no intriguing repeated patterns that we are interested in studying.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Prototype selection</em></p>
<!-- Why instance selection -->
<p>Supervised learning uses a training set of known information to categorize new events through instance selection. Instance selection (<span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-olvera2010review" role="doc-biblioref">Olvera-L’opez et al.</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-olvera2010review" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>) is a method of rejecting instances that are not helpful for classification. This is analogous to subsampling the population along all dimensions of interest such that the sampled data represents the primary features of the underlying distribution. Instance selection in unsupervised learning has received little attention in the literature, yet it could be a useful tool for evaluating model or method performance. There are several ways to approach prototype selection.
Following <span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-Fan2021-bq" role="doc-biblioref">Fan et al.</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Fan2021-bq" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>’s idea of picking related examples (neighbors) for each instance (anchor), we can first use any dimensionality reduction techniques like MDS or PCA to project the data into a 2D space. Then pick a few “anchor” customers who are far apart in 2D space and pick a few neighbors for each. Unfortunately, this does not ensure that consumers with significant patterns across all variables are chosen. Tours can reveal variable separation that was hidden in a single variable display better than static projections. Hence we perform a linked tour with a t-SNE layout using the R package <code>liminal</code> (<span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-R-liminal" role="doc-biblioref">Lee</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-R-liminal" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>) to identify customers who are more likely to have distinct patterns across the variables studied. (Refer to Supplementary article for further details). Figure  shows the distribution across <code>hod</code> (a), <code>moy</code>(b) and <code>wnwd</code> (c) for the set of chosen <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span> customers that were chosen. Few of these customers have similar distribution across <code>moy</code> and some are similar in their <code>hod</code> distribution.</p>

<!-- - show raw data of moy, hod, wkndwday patterns for them -->
<div id="clustering" class="section level3" number="4.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Clustering</h3>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span> prototypes <!--and the data subset consisting of $353$ customers--> are clustered using the methodology described in Section  and results are reported below. In the following plots, the median is shown by a line, and the shaded region shows the area between the <span class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span>. All customers with the same color represent the same clustered groups. Groups by JS-based distances and wpd-based distances are colored differently as they represent different groupings. The plotting scales are not displayed since we want to emphasize comparable shapes rather than scales. The idea is that a customer in a cluster may have low total energy usage, but their behavior may be quite similar to a customer with high usage with respect to distributional pattern or significance across cyclic granularities.</p>
<div id="js-based-distances" class="section level4" number="4.4.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1.1</span> JS-based distances</h4>
<p>For clustering based on JS-based distances, we chose the optimal number of clusters using (<span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-Hennig2014-ah" role="doc-biblioref">Hennig</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Hennig2014-ah" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>) as <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. The groupings are shown in Figure . Customers with the same color represent the same clustered groups. Our methodology is useful for grouping similar distributions over <code>hod</code> and <code>moy</code> and they are placed closely for easy comparison. Few groups have mixed patterns across <code>hod</code> and <code>moy</code>, but few have all customers in the group having a similar profile. Figure  shows the summarized distributions across <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> groups and assists us in characterizing each cluster. It shows Groups <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> have <code>hod</code> pattern with a typical morning and evening peak, whereas groups <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> show a <code>moy</code> pattern with higher usage in winter months. Differences in Weekend/Weekday between groups are not discernible, implying that it may not be a relevant variable in distinguishing various clusters unless maybe conditioned by <code>moy</code> or <code>hod</code>. It may be interesting to compare these two plots to verify if the summarized distributions across groups correctly characterized the groupings. If it has, then the majority of the group’s members should share a similar profile.</p>

A parallel coordinate plot with the three significant cyclic granularities is used to characterize the groups here.

This means that <span class="math inline">\(moy\)</span> is the most important variable in distinguishing the groups followed by <span class="math inline">\(hod\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(wnwd\)</span>. There is only one customer who has significant <span class="math inline">\(wpd\)</span> across <span class="math inline">\(wnwd\)</span> and stands out from the rest of the customers. Group 3 has a higher wpd for hod than moy or wkndwday. Group 2 has the most distinct pattern across moy. Group 1 is a mixed group that has strong patterns on at least one of the three variables.

</p>
</div>
<p>Things become far more complicated when we consider a larger data set with more uncertainty, as they do with any clustering problem. Summarizing distributions across clusters with varied or outlying customers can result in a shape that does not represent the group. Furthermore, combining heterogeneous customers may result in similar-looking final clusters that are not effective for visually differentiating them. It is also worth noting that the Weekend/Weekday behavior in the given case does not characterize any cluster. This, however, will not be true for all of the customers in the data set. If more extensive prototype selection is used, resulting in more comprehensive prototypes in the data set, this method might be used to classify the entire data set into these prototype behaviors. However, the goal of this section was to have a few customers that have significant patterns over one or more cyclic granularities, apply our methodology to cluster them, and demonstrate that the method produces useful clusters.</p>
