<!-- background of the problem -->
<!--Exploratory data analysis, as coined by John W. Tukey [@Tukey1977-jx] involves many iterations of finding structures and patterns that allow the data to be informative.-->
<p>Cyclic temporal granularities <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Bettini1998-ed" role="doc-biblioref">Bettini et al. 1998</a>; <a href="bibliography.html#ref-Gupta2021-gravitas" role="doc-biblioref">Gupta et al. 2021</a>)</span> are <!--theoretical--> temporal deconstructions that define cyclic repetitions in time, e.g. hour-of-day, day-of-month, or regularly scheduled public holidays. These granularities form ordered or unordered categorical variables. An example of an ordered granularity is day-of-week, where Tuesday is always followed by Wednesday, and so on. An unordered granularity example is . We can use granularities to explore patterns in univariate time series by examining the distribution of the measured variable across different categories of the cyclic granularities.</p>

Figure 3.1: A cyclic granularity can be considered to be a categorical variable, and used to break the data into subsets. Here, side-by-side boxplots overlaid on jittered dotplots explore the distribution of of energy use by a household for two different cyclic granularities: (a) hour-of-day and (b) and month-of-year. Daily peaks occur in morning and evening hours, indicating a working household, where members leave for and return from work. More volatility of usage in summer months (Jan, Feb) is probably due air conditioner use on just some days.
</p>
</div>
<p>As a motivating example, consider Figure  which shows electricity smart meter data plotted against two granularities (hour-of-day, month-of-year). The data was collected on a single household in Melbourne, Australia, over a six month period, and was previously used in <span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-wang2020calendar" role="doc-biblioref">Wang, Cook, and Hyndman</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-wang2020calendar" role="doc-biblioref">2020b</a>)</span>. The categorical variable (granularity) is mapped to the x-axis, and the distribution of the response variable is displayed using both side-by-side jittered dotplots and boxplots. From panel (a) it can be seen that energy consumption is higher during the morning hours (5–8), when members in the household wake up, and again in the evening hours (17–20) possibly when members get back from work. In addition, the largest variation in energy use is in the afternoon hours (12–16), as seen in the length of the boxes. From panel (b), it is seen that the variability in energy usage is higher in Jan and Feb, probably due to the usage of air conditioners on some days. The median usage is highest in January, dips in February–April and rises again in May–June, although not to the height of January usage. This suggests that the household does not use as much electricity for heating as it does for air conditioning. A lot of households in Victoria use gas heating and hence the heater use might not be reflected in the electricity data.</p>
<p>Many different displays could be constructed using different granularities including day-of-week, day-of-month, weekday/weekend, etc. However, only a few might be interesting and reveal important patterns in energy usage. Determining which displays have “significant” distributional differences between categories of the cyclic granularity, and plotting only these, would make for efficient exploration.</p>

<!-- comparing one and two grans for one households -->
<p>Exploring the distribution of the measured variable across two cyclic granularities provides more detailed information on its structure. For example, Figure (a) shows the usage distribution across hour-of-day conditional on month-of-year across two households. It shows the hourly usage over a day does not remain the same across months. Unlike other months, the 75th and 90th percentile for all hours of the day in January are high, similar, and are not characterized by a morning and evening peak. The household in Figure (b) has 90th percentile consumption higher in summer months relative to autumn or winter, but the 75th and 90th percentile are far apart in all months, implying that the second household resorts to air conditioning much less regularly than the first one. The differences seem to be more prominent across month-of-year (facets) than hour-of-day (x-axis) for this household, whereas they are prominent for both cyclic granularities for the first household.</p>
<!-- The problem and its dimension -->
<p>Are all four displays in Figures  and  useful in understanding the distributional difference in energy usage? Which ones are more useful than others? If <span class="math inline">\(N_C\)</span> is the total number of cyclic granularities of interest, the number of displays that could be potentially informative is <span class="math inline">\(N_C\)</span> when considering displays of the form in Figure . The dimension of the problem, however, increases when considering more than one cyclic granularity. When considering displays of the form in Figure ,
there are <span class="math inline">\(N_C(N_C-1)\)</span> possible pairwise plots exhaustively, with one of the two cyclic granularities acting as the conditioning variable.
This can be overwhelming for human consumption even for moderately large <span class="math inline">\(N_C\)</span>. It is therefore useful to identify those displays that are informative across at least one cyclic granularity.</p>
<!-- Moreover, the volatility in consumption are almost equal and high for all hours in Jan, whereas variability is most in the evening hours for other months. The distribution of consumption across different hours of the day look similar for Apr, May and Jun, characterized by a distinct morning, afternoon and evening peaks and higher variability in evening hours -->
<!-- months Jan and Feb not only have a high median consumption, but also more variability, possibly due to the usage of air conditioning. The other months shows more consistent behavior with the energy consumption rising in May and June. -->
<!-- Scagnostics literature, other literature and why we need more/different -->
<p>This problem is similar to Scagnostics (Scatterplot Diagnostics) by <span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-tukey1988computer" role="doc-biblioref">Tukey and Tukey</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-tukey1988computer" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>)</span>, which are used to identify meaningful patterns in large collections of scatterplots. Given a set of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> variables, there are <span class="math inline">\(v(v-1)/2\)</span> pairs of variables, and thus the same number of possible pairwise scatterplots. Therefore, even for small <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, the number of scatterplots can be large, and scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs) can easily run out of pixels when presenting high-dimensional data. <span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-Dang2014-tw" role="doc-biblioref">Dang and Wilkinson</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Dang2014-tw" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-wilkinson2005graph" role="doc-biblioref">Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-wilkinson2005graph" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> provide potential solutions to this, where a few characterizations can be used to locate anomalies in density, shape, trend, and other features in the 2D point scatters.</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide a solution to narrowing down the search from <span class="math inline">\(N_C(N_C-1)\)</span> conditional distribution plots by introducing a new distance measure that can be used to detect significant distributional differences across cyclic granularities.<!-- harmonies and why it is not enough --> This work is a natural extension of our previous work <span class="citation">(<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Gupta2021-gravitas" role="doc-biblioref">Gupta et al. 2021</a>)</span> which narrows down the search from <span class="math inline">\(N_C(N_C-1)\)</span> plots by identifying pairs of granularities that can be meaningfully examined together (a “harmony”), or when they cannot (a “clash”). However, even after excluding clashes, the list of harmonies left may be too large for exhaustive exploration. Hence, there is a need to reduce the search even further by including only those harmonies that contain useful information.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-inference" role="doc-biblioref">Buja et al.</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-inference" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="bibliography.html#ref-Majumder2013-hb" role="doc-biblioref">Majumder, Hofmann, and Cook</a> (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Majumder2013-hb" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> present methods for statistical significance testing of visual findings using human cognition as the statistical tests. In this paper, the visual discovery of distributional differences is facilitated by choosing a threshold for the proposed numerical distance measure, eventually selecting only those cyclic granularities for which the distributional differences are sufficient to make it an interesting display.</p>
<!-- \ref{fig:id2-new2} shows the distribution of energy consumption across hour-of-day conditional on month-of-year. \ref{fig:id2-new2}(a) shows that energy consumption is higher during the morning hours when members in the household wake up and then again higher in the evening hours possibly when members are back from work with them showing maximum variable behavior in the afternoon hours. \ref{fig:id2-new2}(b) shows the months Jan and Feb not only have a high median consumption, but also more variability, possibly due to the usage of air conditioning. The other months shows more consistent behavior with the energy consumption rising in May and June. \ref{fig:id2-new2} adds to this information, by showing that hours in Jan do not necessarily follow the same pattern across the day (due to Holidays, people visiting). Moreover, the volatility in consumption are almost equal and high for all hours in Jan, whereas variability is most in the evening hours for other months. The distribution of consumption across different hours of the day look similar for Apr, May and Jun, characterized by a distinct morning, afternoon and evening peaks and higher variability in evening hours. -->
<!-- # interaction for two households, importance could be across one -->
<!-- Even when it is known which all interactions to look at, all of them would not be interesting and that too will vary across different households. -->
<!-- calendar plots -->
<!-- The authors show how hour-of-the-day interact with weekdays and weekends and then move on to use calendar display to show daily schedules. The calendar display has several components in it, which helps us to look at energy consumption across hour-of-day, day-of-week, week-of-month, and month-of-year at once. Some interaction of these cyclic granularities, for example, how day-of-week relates to month-of-year, could also be interpreted from this display. This is a great way for having an overview of energy consumption. However, if one wants to understand the repetitiveness in energy behavior and how they interact in greater detail, it is not easy to comprehend the interactions of all cyclic granularities from this display, due to the combination of linear and cyclic representation of time. For example, this display might not be the best to understand how hour-of-the-day or month-of-year varies across week-of-the-month as well as with each other. Furthermore, it is not clear what all interactions of cyclic granularities should be read from this display as there could be many combinations that one can look at. Moreover, there could be non-conventional cyclic granularities, which could potentially become useful depending on the context. -->
<!-- context when it could be useful is monitoring heart rates. There are devices that can detect each heartbeat and transfer the data to a receiver such as a watch or phone. These data could be available for a temporal scale as fine as a minute and it could be of interest to see regular patterns across any deconstruction of time coarser than a minute. -->
<!-- Again, look at \ref{fig:} c and d, where energy consumption for these two households are plotted against (weekend/weekday, week-of-month). Here, for both households, the pattern of energy consumption vary across different weeks of the month irrespective of the fact it is a weekday or weekend. In that respect, the harmony pair (month-of-year, hour-of-day) seems to be more informative than (weekend/weekday, week-of-month) for the first household. -->
<!-- Take an example of a data set which are observed at fine temporal scales, like that of NYC bike usage available at https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data. We use the `nyc_bikes` data set from the R package `tsibbledata` which takes a sample of 10 bikes for the year 2018. The `start_time` and the `stop_time` are recorded to a fineness of seconds. We can look at pair of cyclic granularities (hour_day, wknd_wday) or (week_month, day_week) to see how these periodicities interact. But there could be other pairs that are important too. How to understand which pairs are sufficient to explore given the data set without losing much information about the data. -->
<!-- When we need to understand the interplay of different periodicities in a high frequency temporal datasets, we have many choices to consider. In [@wang2020tsibble] and [@wang2020calendar], periodicities are explored across hour of the day and day of the week or months. But calendar effects are not restricted to conventional day-of-week or month-of-year deconstructions. -->
<!-- If we have $n$ periodic linear granularities in the hierarchy table, then $n(n-1)/2$ circular or quasi-circular cyclic granularities could be constructed. -->
<!-- Our contributions in this paper are: -->
<p><!-- * We introduce a new distance measure for detecting periodic interactions. This induces data reduction which allows for identification of patterns, if any, in the time series data. --></p>
<p><!-- * We show that the distance metric could be used to rank the periodic patterns based on how well they capture the variation in the measured variable as they have been normalized for different number of comparisons. --></p>
<p><!-- * We device a framework for choosing a threshold, which will result in detection of only significantly interesting periodic patterns in the time series data. --></p>
<p><!-- * --></p>
<p><!-- * ; --></p>
<p><!-- * show that the proposed distance metric could be used to rank the interesting patterns across different datasets and temporal granularities since they have been normalized for relevant parameters. --></p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. Section  introduces a distance measure for detecting distributional difference in temporal granularities, which enables identification of patterns in the time series data;
Section  devises a selection criterion by choosing a threshold, which results in detection of only significantly interesting patterns. Section  provides a simulation study on the proposed methodology. Section  presents an application to residential smart meter data in Melbourne to show how the proposed methodology can be used to automatically detect temporal granularities along which distributional differences are significant.</p>
<!-- acts as a way to automatically detect periodic patterns in time series. -->
<!-- Also, ranking the remaining harmony pairs based on how well they capture the variation in the measured variable could be potentially useful.  -->
<!-- Talk about Scagnostics: Tukey -->
