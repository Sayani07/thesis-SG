# Abstract {-}

The research was motivated by the desire to understand the Australian smart meters data, which was collected half-hourly for two years at the household level. With temporal data available at ever finer scales, exploring periodicity can become overwhelming with so many possible temporal deconstructions to explore. Analysts are expected to comprehensively explore the many ways to view and consider temporal data. However, the plethora of choices and the lack of a systematic approach to do so quickly can make the task overwhelming.


<!-- exploration may be required to be carried out across both finer and coarser scales to draw useful inferences about the underlying process. It is important to be able to navigate through all the temporal deconstructions that accommodate for periodicities to have multiple perspectives of the observed data. This idea aligns with the notion of EDA (Tukey 1977) which emphasizes the use of multiple perspectives on data to help formulate hypotheses before proceeding to hypothesis testing. Slicing and dicing the data in all possible temporal scales as suggested by EDA can be a daunting task as it leads to a -->
<!-- myriad of possibilities. -->

<!-- <WHY> <WHAT> <HOW> -->

This work investigates how time may be dissected, resulting in alternative data segmentation and, as a result, different visualizations that can aid in the identification of underlying patterns. The first contribution (Chapter \@ref(ch:gravitas)) describes classes of time deconstructions using linear and cyclic time granularities. It provides tools to compute possible cyclic granularities from an ordered (usually temporal) index and also a framework to systematically explore the distribution of a univariate variable conditional on two cyclic time granularities by defining "harmony". "harmony" denotes pairs of granularities that could be analyzed together and reduces the search from all possible options. This approach is still overwhelming for human consumption because there would still be a huge number of harmonies. Hence, the second contribution (Chapter \@ref(ch:hakear)) refines the search of informative granularities by identifying those for which the differences between the displayed distributions are greatest and rating them in order of importance of capturing maximum variation. The third contribution (Chapter \@ref(ch:gracsr)) builds upon the first two to provide methods for exploring heterogeneities in repetitive behavior for many households and over multiple granularities. It accomplishes this by providing a way to cluster time series based on probability distributions across informative cyclic granularities. Although we were motivated by the smart meter example, the problem and the solutions we propose are practically relevant to any temporal data observed more than once per year.

<!-- there is a need to resort to clustering, which has been addressed in  It approaches the problem by computing pairwise distances between time series based on probability distributions over multiple cyclic granularities at once. -->

## supervisors
Rob and Di are phenomenal leaders in their respective fields, who lead by example. I am inspired by their creativity, wisdom, discipline, and dedication to really contribute to the society through their research. Thank you for constantly pushing me to improve as a programmer and researcher, and for regularly sharing best practices for conducting research. Looking back, I am grateful for how my thoughts and work in statistical computing, graphics, and data analytics in general have evolved over the years. I still have a lot to learn, but I am a much more self-reliant and independent researcher than I was when I started. Di has been instrumental in exposing me to the potential benefits of effective data visualization. As a female researcher, I am encouraged by her willingness to pursue unconventional avenues and have frequently noticed her make a conscious decision to question existing  stereotypes and biases. Thank you Di for being a fantastic female role model.

## friends

PhD in Covid has been harder and I would not have been able to make it through this if not for the emotional support of my friends and family. Thank you Puwasala, Sium for being an epitome of kindness and acting as a pillar of support. Thank you Tushar, Samarpita and Nairita for always motivating me and believing in me when I didn't believe in myself. Thank you Ian for always putting things in perspective when I lost sight. Thank you each one of you for being available, listening to me, and not giving up on me at my lowest. Thanks to my housemates Anjali, Surbhi and Dulaji for the fun company and conversations that kept me sane in the covid lockdowns.

## family
Finally, a big thanks to my family for always being supportive of my choices. Thanks to my mum (Nupur Gupta) and dad (Arun Prasad Gupta), from whom I learnt that no matter where you start from, if you persevere and are sincere in your efforts, you can sail through any difficult situation. They are my constant cheerleaders for all little and big endeavours. Thanks to my brother (Avijit) for always having my back and inspiring me to dream bigger. Thank you, Juhi (sister-in-law) for instilling in me the value of organisation in all aspects of life and the importance of prioritizing my physical health from time to time. Thank you all for your part in supporting me in this journey. I love you.Â
