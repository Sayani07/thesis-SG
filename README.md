## Reproducible research using `renv`

This research project uses the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package to create reproducible environments. A project-specific library will be created when you open this project with R/RStudio. Run `renv::restore()` to install a long list of packages with the same versions that are used to produce this manuscript.
